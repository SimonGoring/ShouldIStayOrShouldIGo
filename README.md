# ShouldIStayOrShouldIGo

This project is intended as a skill building exercise as part of the [UBC R Stats Group]().  The project is intended to develop an interactive map that can be used by individuals to tell whether it's (on average) faster to walk or wait for a bus at any one point in the city of Vancouver.

The project uses the [Translink API](https://developer.translink.ca/).  If you intend to work on this project, or want to have it functional on your local instance, please be sure to [register for the open API](https://developer.translink.ca/Account/Register).

## Development

We welcome contributions from any individual, whether code, documentation, or issue tracking. All participants are expected to follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/ROpensci/neotoma/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md) for this project.
